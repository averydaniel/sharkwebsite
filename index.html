    <p>Hello world. This is a paragraph about sharks. There are a lot of species out there, big and small. Some sharks are more aggressive towards humans, like tiger and bull sharks. Some are small and preety harmless, like nurse sharks and pacific angels. Usually, bigger sharks are at the top of the food chain, the apex predator if you will, but some live more peacefully, like Greenland sharks and whale sharks. Greenland sharks live in very cold water. Due to this, they have a slower metabolism, so they have to eat less frequently. They also can live a very long time, the oldest living on is 392 years old! Whale sharks are cool because of 1: Their size, and 2: Their lifestyle. </p>
